=============

Description
----------
This is a network institute project. 

Installation
-----------
Clone the repository from github

````shell
git clone https://github.com/SBelkaid/learning_from_mistakes.git
````
You will need to have installed the conda package manager (https://www.continuum.io). Will save you a lot of time installing seperate packages

Usage
-----

These are python scripts that use tkinter to show a gui. Basically, multiple screans run at the same time and to swith to a different screen that screen is put infront of the other by calling it by its ID.

```shell

NameOfComputer: python generator.py #to parse all the files in the theses folder

```

To do
------------
To do:
- DONE Buttons om te navigeren tussen exercises fixen
- Running GUI Code Three Ways --> check programming python book 
- DONE Storing values of checkbuttons
- DONE adding correct answers to question dictionairy 
- DONE Checking the values, build a seperate frame element for checking freely typed input in text widget. DONE need to add logic for checking the inputted values.
	- NEED to generate feedback based on incorrect user input. Need pre-made feedback. 
- PARTLY Adding counter to let user know which question it is. The methods have been added. STILL need to decide if the methods that make this happen should be in the controller or not. 
- Displaying help text, if question hasn't been answered correctly, help text should be generated based on mistake made
- PARTLY Instead of multiple choice, make a text field and store the value STILL need to store the value
- DONE Make a main display where one can navigate throught the questions. So the first page displays the amount of exercises, the page after displays the amount of questions a certain exercise has.

- Finishing screen, after the exercises have been made show display overview. Or something similar like a final screen for each exercise. Currently it jumps back to start page where it shows the overview of exercise. Maybe showing the percentage of correctly answered questions once returned to the start page behind every exercise button.


Future Work
