usage: python generator.py

To do:
- DONE Buttons om te navigeren tussen exercises fixen
- Running GUI Code Three Ways --> check programming python book 
- DONE Storing values of checkbuttons
- DONE adding correct answers to question dictionairy 
- DONE Checking the values, build a seperate frame element for checking freely typed input in text widget. DONE need to add logic for checking the inputted values.
	- NEED to generate feedback based on user incorrect user input. Need pre-made feedback. 
- PARTLY Adding counter to let user know which question it is. The methods have been added. STILL need to decide if the methods that make this happen should be in the controller or not. 
- Displaying help text, if question hasn't been answered correctly, help text should be generated based on mistake made
- PARTLY Instead of multiple choice, make a text field and store the value STILL need to store the value
- DONE Make a main display where one can navigate throught the questions. So the first page displays the amount of exercises, the page after displays the amount of questions a certain exercis has.
- Finishing screen, after the exercises have been made show display overview.


Hier nog over nadenken
- Antwoorden gelijk feedback geven of achteraf nadat alle vragen zijn gemaakt.
- De feedback in de frame zetten of losse window
- Kunnen we hints geven, los van de opdracht, we zouden ook de opdracht de hele tijd in beeld kunnen laten
- Open vragen of multiple choice
